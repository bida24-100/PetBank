<p>This is a simple website to help these little animals to find a home using Github.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of a cute ferret:</p>"A cute ferret"
  his name Garry and he is 7 months, we found him wondering on the streets which is no places for a little guys like him
  and we are hoping to find him a loving home>
  <p>Garry is very friendly and very active he loves to play and run arond so having a big space to play would be recommended.
  He can also be very clingy so there is no need to worry about him going anywhere.</p>
