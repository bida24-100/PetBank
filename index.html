<p>This is to help these little animals to find a home and forever friend.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of a cute ferret:</p>
  his name Garry and he is 7 months, we found him wondering on the streets which is no places for a little guys like him
  and we are hoping to find him a loving home>
  <p>Garry is very friendly and very active he loves to play and run arond so having a big space to play would be recommended.
  He can also be very clingy so there is no need to worry about him going anywhere.He is one of only the many animals that need a home, so check out our website 
  you might find a little friend too.</p>
