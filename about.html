<p>The aim of this ebsite is to help the animals who have no home or have found themselves in places where they shouldnt be
  ,not matter what animal it is we aim to protectfrom other as well as protect them from hurting others </p>

<p> We want to uphold this ,so i ask that every and any animal that is not supposed to be there or looks to be suffering and in need of help should be
reported to us so that we can handle it as well as take care of it wether that means taking it back to where it belongs or find a place for it.</p>
